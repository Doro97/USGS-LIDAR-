# USGS-LIDAR

The objective of this project is to measure elevation of a field at many different points in order to provide a better understanding to AgriTech on how water flows through a field and which parts are likely to be flooded ot too dry

This project aims at producing an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.The code interfaces with USGS 3DEP and fetches data using their API.
