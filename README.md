# USGS-LIDAR

The objective of this project is to measure elevation of a field at many different points in order to provide a better understanding to AgriTech on how water flows through a field and which parts are likely to be flooded or too dry

This project aims at producing an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.The code interfaces with USGS 3DEP and fetches data using their API. 
The iowa.json file code has been adapted from https://pdal.io/tutorial/iowa-entwine.html


The tasks are divided as follows:

1. Data Fetching and Loading
2. Visualization of the Terrain
3. Data transformation


# Data Fetching and Loading
The data is read from the USGS 3DEP AWS Public Dataset using the PDAL package. PDAL enables composing of operations on point clouds into pipelines. Pipelines define the processing of data within PDAL. They describe how point cloud data are read; processed and written .The pipeline can be written in a declarative JSON syntax or constructed using an available API. The PDAL pipeline is divided into the following stages: Readers, Filters and Writers. To create the pipeline the following functions are used: readers.ept is used to fetch the data, filters. outlier to filter it for noise , filters.smrf to classify the data as ground or not ground and writer.gdal to write out a digital terrain model.
## Steps followed:
1. A file with the name iowa.json is created
2. readers.ept reads the point cloud data from the EPT resource on AWS. We give it a URL to the root of the resource in the filename option, and we also give it a bounds object to define the window in which we should select data from.
3. The data we are selecting may have noise properly classified, and we can use filters.range to keep all data that does not have a Classification Dimensions value of 7.
4. After removing points that have noise classifications, we need to reset all of the classification values in the point data. filters.assign takes the expression 
Classification [:]=0 and assigns the Classification for each point to 0.
5.The data on the AWS 3DEP Public Dataset are stored in Web Mercator coordinate system, which is not suitable for many operations. We need to reproject them into an appropriate UTM coordinate system (EPSG:26915).
6.The Simple Morphological Filter (filters.smrf) classifies points as ground or not-ground.
7.After we have executed the SMRF filter, we only want to keep points that are actually classified as ground in our point stream. Selecting for points with Classification[2:2] does that for us.
8.Having filtered our point data, weâ€™re now ready to write a raster digital terrain model with writers.gdal. Interesting options we choose here are to set the nodata value, specify only outputting the inverse distance weighted raster, and assigning a resolution of 1 (m).
9.We can also write a LAZ file containing the same points that were used to make the elevation model in the section above
## Executing the pipeline
1.Save the PDAL pipeline in Pipeline to a file called iowa.json
2.Invoke the PDAL pipeline command
