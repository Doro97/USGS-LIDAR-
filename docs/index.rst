Welcome to 3dLidar's documentation!
===================================

3d Lidar is a Python library for fetching, visualising and transforming publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.
The code interfaces with USGS 3DEP and fetches data using their API. It pulls data from the `USGS database <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.
